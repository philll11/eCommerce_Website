# eCommerce_Website
This website was built as part my web development assignment. Assignment specification will be included in the README


# Your site MUST have:

a home page and 6 - 10 content pages, which have a consistent format and include content relevant to your intended audience. Linked images and PDFs are not part of this page count.
a table, utilizing data effectively

all formatting done via CSS using an external CSS file containing at least six styles
don't use the FONT tag, or inline, embedded, physical or logical styles.
a Google Map (either static or interactive) centred on a city other than Palmerston North.

one or more forms that contains at least four fields including one that is numeric and an email address. These must use the appropriate HTML5 elements.
When the form submit button is pressed, the form data along with the current timestamp is saved to HTML5 localStorage. You have a page called collected_data.html that has buttons that can both Display Submissions and Clear all collected form submissions.


# Each page must:

•	include appropriate page title and meta-tags
•	have links to both HTML & CSS validators
•	include a multimedia element (you are not required to create it, simply include it)
•	have an e-mail link (which can be fictitious – you don't need to use personal email address)
•	adhere to accessibility guidelines: http://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/
There is a W3C list of accessibility checkers here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/
